\title{Central Limit Theorem Simulation for Binomial Distribution}
\usage{
mycltb(n, iter, p = 0.5, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. The sample size for each iteration of random sampling (must be > 0).}

\item{iter}{Integer. The number of iterations for generating random samples (must be > 0).}

\item{p}{Numeric. The probability of success for the Binomial distribution. Must be between 0 and 1. Default is 0.5.}

\item{...}{Additional graphical parameters passed to the `hist` function (e.g., `breaks`, `col`).}
}
\value{
A histogram of sample means with an overlaid normal curve for comparison.
}
\description{
This function simulates the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) by generating random samples
from a Binomial distribution, computing sample means, and comparing their distribution
to the theoretical normal curve.
}
\examples{
# Simulate CLT with sample size 30, 1000 iterations, and p = 0.5
mycltb(30, 1000, p = 0.5)
}
